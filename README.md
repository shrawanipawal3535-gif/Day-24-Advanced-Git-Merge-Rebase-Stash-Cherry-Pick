# Day-24-Advanced-Git-Merge-Rebase-Stash-Cherry-Pick
Merge:
Merge combines one branch into another branch and keeps full history.
 It may create a merge commit.
Rebase:
Rebase moves your branch on top of another branch and makes history linear.
 It rewrites commit history.
Stash:
Stash temporarily saves uncommitted changes.
 Useful when switching branches quickly.
Cherry-Pick:
Cherry-pick copies one specific commit to another branch.
 It does not merge the whole branch.
